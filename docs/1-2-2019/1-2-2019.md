## Topics and Researches

The first group meeting, we were talking about several topics which we are interested in.

I was interested in two topic and did some researches:
1.	According the festival map, which can display the visualization of visitors’ emotion.

    Installation:  interaction reaction, motion capture

    Concept: let abstract become concrete. For example, detect heartbeat of audiences, facial expression, in the end, installation could create unique shape or pattern of every audience.
