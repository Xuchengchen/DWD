## Workshop

We made a demo for our idea in the workshop. It's quite useful to make it and show to others to see whether it works or if there's anything need to be enhanced.

### Demo

Below is the demo made in the workshop. There are three dials for different functionalities and a button for selection. BTW, the making process can be quite tricky.
