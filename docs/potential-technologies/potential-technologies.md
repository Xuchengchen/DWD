# Potential Technologies

This page would discuss all potential technologies with their functionalities might be used in the project.

## Draft 1

There would be two processes included:
1. [Users' activities detection](###Users'-activities-detection-process)
2. [Event recommendation](###Event-recommendation)

### Users' activities detection process

* RFID. Could be used to recognized the apperance of different entities. This tech can be used to detect the order of users' selection according to the order of the apperance of users' identity.
* Motion detection of users. This may involve video gesture recognition and it can be pretty difficult to implement properly. Might be used to detect special guesture of users which potentially can be used for mental model building.
* Embended computer. Such as Arduino. This can be used to connect all different sensors and handle data analysis tasks. Tech specs: 1-2 GB memory, 8-64 GB storage depends on SD card used, CPU with 1-2 GHz in ARM 7 serious. Potentially can handle parallel serial inputs and simple data analysis.
* Sensors. IR, loudness, button, wifi, bluetooth, vibration (inaccurate), tension, and so on.

### Event recommendation

* Screen / iPad.
* Distance sensor.
* Printer.
