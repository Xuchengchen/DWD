# Potential Technologies

This page would discuss all potential technologies with their functionalities might be used in the project.

## Draft 1

There would be two processes included:
1. [Users' activities detection](#users-activities-detection-process)
2. [Event recommendation](#event-recommendation)

### Users' activities detection process

* RFID. Could be used to recognized the apperance of different entities. This tech can be used to detect the order of users' selection according to the order of the apperance of users' identity.
* Motion detection of users. This may involve video gesture recognition and it can be pretty difficult to implement properly. Might be used to detect special guesture of users which potentially can be used for mental model building.
* Embended computer. Such as Arduino. This can be used to connect all different sensors and handle data analysis tasks. Tech specs: 1-2 GB memory, 8-64 GB storage depends on SD card used, CPU with 1-2 GHz in ARM 7 serious. Potentially can handle parallel serial inputs and simple data analysis.
* Sensors. IR, loudness, button, wifi, bluetooth, vibration (inaccurate), tension, and so on.

### Event recommendation

* Screen / iPad.
* Distance sensor.
* Printer.

## Draft 2

According to recent **_comfortable atmosphere_** design,there are sound and light effect, together with dial/button controls, involved in.

### Controls

* Dial. Can be implemented by a potentiometer in serial to the function circuit for analogue signals. Or using a potentiometer in a control signal circuit, sending to Arduino, for digital signals.

* Button. Could be used in the function circuit.

### Light effect

* There should be some gimbal implementations can be used to give rotation to those lights.

* Brightness can be controlled by potentiometer in serial to the circuit.

### Sound effect

*
